## How to run the app

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx install-expo-modules@latest
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

3. The app won't work if you don't have your own .env.local file with your own EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID and EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT


### To run the app in Android or IOS, you need to download the EXPO app in the app store or the google play store and scan the qr code in the terminal after you start expo.
